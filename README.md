This research is aimed at studying the case of customers' default payments in Taiwan through different machine learning models, as well as comparing the predictive accuracy of probability of default among them. The expansion of new business in credit cards has driven banks to lower the requirements for credit card approvals, and young people have become their target customers although they tend not to have enough income. In the beginning of 2006, the Taiwanese credit card debt reached $268 billion USD (Wang, 2022). Therefore, revealing the predictors for individualsâ€™ financial behavior associated with credit card default is of importance to achieve reliable credit risk management.
