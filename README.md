# Advanced-Data-Analysis Course Project
This research is aimed at studying the case of customers' default payments in Taiwan through different machine learning models, as well as comparing the predictive accuracy of probability of default among them. The expansion of new business in credit cards has driven banks to lower the requirements for credit card approvals, and young people have become their target customers although they tend not to have enough income. In the beginning of 2006, the Taiwanese credit card debt reached $268 billion USD (Wang, 2022). Therefore, revealing the predictors for individuals’ financial behavior associated with credit card default is of importance to achieve reliable credit risk management. /
This research collects 20000 instances related from clients’ default payment which includes 24 variables, ranging from basic information of customers and information about their bill and payment conditions. Machine learning techniques for classification, including KNN, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting methodologies, are applied to predict the correct class of individual’s default behavior. In order to train different models and improve the accuracy of prediction, this project randomly split the dataset to train dataset (20000 * 0.7) and test dataset (20000 * 0.3). And thus, model evaluation metrics are developed by comparing the performance of the set of machine learning algorithms. /
